I am a research engineer at [Woven by Toyota](https://woven.toyota/en/). My work investigates **remote communication**. I focus on experimental design, data collection, statistical analyses, coding, data visualization, and the promotion of reproducible research practices.

<!-- My interests are in phonetics, speech synthesis, and memory. -->

Previously I was a postdoctoral researcher at the [Speech and Audio Processing Laboratory](http://sap.ist.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/EN/) at [Kyoto University](https://www.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en) working with [Prof. Dr. Tatsuya Kawahara](http://sap.ist.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/members/kawahara/) researching **spoken dialogue systems** for **human-robot interaction** and **virtual agents**.

I completed my PhD at [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/start.html) with [Prof. Dr. Bernd Möbius](https://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/~moebius/mywww/index.html) and [Dr. Jürgen Trouvain](https://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/~trouvain/). I was part of the  [PINTS project](http://pauseparticles.org/) which focused on pause-internal phonetic particles in speech communication. I examined the influence of **pause particles in speech synthesis**.
