I am a PhD researcher for the [PINTS project](http://pauseparticles.org/) which focuses on pause-internal phonetic particles in speech communication. Within that project, I examine the influence of **pause particles in speech synthesis**. My supervisors are [Prof. Dr. Bernd Möbius](https://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/~moebius/mywww/index.html) and [Dr. Jürgen Trouvain](https://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/~trouvain/). I am part of the [Language Science and Technology](https://www.lst.uni-saarland.de/) department at [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/start.html), Saarbrücken, Germany. My interests are in phonetics, speech synthesis, and memory. My work involves experimental design, data collection, statistical analyses, coding, data visualization, and the promotion of reproducible research practices.
